                    Welcome to my online home. I primarily use this site for
                    behind-the-scenes software development, but in the spirit of
                    what the web was when I first found it (you know, "back in
                    the old days"), I like to share a few parts of my life with
                    anyone out there who is mildly interested.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a full time job and a great life away from this computer
                    so I don't really update much of this site very often. However,
                    that doesn't mean you shouldn't check back occasionally to see
                    (or just use the RSS feed). And by all means feel free to drop
                    me a line.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I don't "blog" but I do occasionally post things that I
                    think other people might find interesting/helpful. You can
                    find my most recent posts below, or take a look under one
                    of the menus for writings on specific topics.

                Here are the most recent things I've written.
                For the rest, check out the site navigation
                for lists of topics and related writings.
